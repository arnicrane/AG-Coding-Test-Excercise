# How I approached the problem:

- 1) Sketch of entities & their responsibilities (Put thoughts down on paper) - see the ./rolesAndResponsibilities folder
- 2 Write failing tests (TDD to have a "steel-thread" defining the MVP) - see the ./tests folder
- 3) Implement solution (Classes and method(s)) and make tests pass - see the ./source folder & run npm test
- 4) Review & Refactor, considering ... - see the comments across the code
    - scalability of the solution,
    - efficiency (space & runtime complexity),
    - separation of concerns through classes & single-purpose-methods,
    - clear naming of classes, methods and variables
